# Seaborn Practice Repository
This repository contains my practice files and exercises while learning data visualization using Matplotlib and Seaborn. It covers various types of plots, statistical visualizations, and techniques for presenting and analyzing data effectively.

# Overview
This repository contains my practice files and exercises while learning Seaborn, a powerful Python visualization library based on Matplotlib. The practice covers essential Seaborn functionalities, including:

- Creating a variety of plots (e.g., pair plots, heatmaps, violin plots)
- Customizing plot aesthetics, themes, and color palettes
- Working with categorical and continuous data visualizations
- Analyzing data relationships using regression and joint plots
- Customizing axis labels, titles, and legends
- Saving and exporting visualizations

Contributions
- Feel free to fork the repository and submit pull requests if you have improvements or additional practice examples to share.
