# Seaborn Practice Repository
This repository contains my practice files and exercises while learning data visualization using Matplotlib and Seaborn. It covers various types of plots, statistical visualizations, and techniques for presenting and analyzing data effectively.

# Overview
This repository contains my practice files and exercises while learning Seaborn, a powerful Python visualization library based on Matplotlib. The practice covers essential Seaborn functionalities, including:

- Creating a variety of plots (e.g., pair plots, heatmaps, violin plots)
- Customizing plot aesthetics, themes, and color palettes
- Working with categorical and continuous data visualizations
- Analyzing data relationships using regression and joint plots
- Customizing axis labels, titles, and legends
- Saving and exporting visualizations


# Seaborn Plots 
- Bar Plot: Displays data as rectangular bars, useful for comparing quantities across different categories.

- Box Plot: Visualizes the distribution of data using quartiles and outliers, showing the spread of a dataset.

- Violin Plot: Combines aspects of box plot and density plot, displaying the distribution and probability density of data.

- Heatmap: Visualizes matrix-like data with color encoding, typically used for correlation or association data.

- Scatter Plot: Shows the relationship between two continuous variables using points on a 2D plane.

- Line Plot: Displays data points connected by straight lines, typically used for time series or trend analysis.

- Pair Plot: Shows pairwise relationships between multiple variables in a dataset using scatter plots and histograms.

- Facet Grid: Creates subplots based on a categorical variable, allowing you to compare distributions across categories.

- Strip Plot: Displays individual data points along a single axis, typically used to show the distribution of categorical data.

- Swarm Plot: Similar to a strip plot but with points adjusted to avoid overlap, showing the distribution of categorical data.

-Count Plot: Displays the count of observations in each category of a categorical variable.
